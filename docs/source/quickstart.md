# Quick start

First, define a thumbnailer to use:

```python
from moar import Thumbnailer

thumbnail = Thumbnailer()
```

Then, make it accesible in your templates. For instance, as a jinja2 global:

```python
render.set_global('thumbnail', thumbnail)
```

Finally, you call it from your templates:

```jinja
<img src="{{ thumbnail(item.image, '100x100') }}" />
```

The thumbnailer function expects at least two parameters:
    * A `source` object. It must have at least a `fullpath` attribute.
    * A `geometry` parameter with the desired width and/or height of the image thumbnail.


You can also invoke it directly from your code, when you want generate the thumbnail right away.

```python
thumbnail(my_file, '100x100')
```

See the [thumbnail](thumbnail.md) section for the available options.
